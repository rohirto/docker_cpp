 * @paragraph Singleton Design
 * The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class 
 * for example a single DB connection shared by multiple objects as creating a separate DB connection for every object may be costly. 
 * Similarly, there can be a single configuration manager or error manager in an application that handles all problems instead of creating 
 * multiple managers. The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. Letâ€™s see various 
 * design options for implementing such a class. If you have a good handle on static class variables and access modifiers this should not 
 * be a difficult task.
 * 
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The constructor, copy constructor, and assignment operator are declared as private to prevent external instantiation and copying of the singleton class.
 * 
 * The getInstance static method is responsible for providing access to the single instance of the class. It uses a static local variable to ensure that only one instance is created.
 * 
 * The main function demonstrates how to access and use the singleton instance.
 * Remember that the implementation of a singleton pattern involves more considerations in a multithreaded environment to ensure thread safety. In such cases, additional mechanisms like mutex or double-checked locking may be needed.
