    "# Exception Handling in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are runtime anomalies or abnormal conditions that a program encounters during its execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of exceptions: \n",
    "1) Synchronous\n",
    "2) Asynchronous (i.e., exceptions which are beyond the program’s control, such as disc failure, keyboard interrupts etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "C++ provides the following specialized keywords for this purpose:\n",
    "- try: Represents a block of code that can throw an exception.\n",
    "- catch: Represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown.\n",
    "- throw: Used to throw an exception. Also used to list the exceptions that a function throws but doesn’t handle itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Exception Handling? \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the main advantages of exception handling over traditional error handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Separation of Error Handling code from Normal Code: In traditional error handling codes, there are always if-else conditions to handle errors. These conditions and the code to handle errors get mixed up with the normal flow. This makes the code less readable and maintainable. With try/catch blocks, the code for error handling becomes separate from the normal flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Functions/Methods can handle only the exceptions they choose: A function can throw many exceptions, but may choose to handle some of them. The other exceptions, which are thrown but not caught, can be handled by the caller. If the caller chooses not to catch them, then the exceptions are handled by the caller of the caller. \n",
    "In C++, a function can specify the exceptions that it throws using the throw keyword. The caller of this function must handle the exception in some way (either by specifying it again or catching it).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Grouping of Error Types: In C++, both basic types and objects can be thrown as exceptions. We can create a hierarchy of exception objects, group exceptions in namespaces or classes and categorize them according to their types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C++ Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "When executing C++ code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an exception (error).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C++ try and catch:\n",
    "Exception handling in C++ consists of three keywords: try, throw and catch:\n",
    "\n",
    "The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed if an error occurs in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The try and catch keywords come in pairs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the try block to test some code: If the value of a variable “age” is less than 18, we will throw an exception, and handle it in our catch block.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the catch block, we catch the error if it occurs and do something about it. The catch statement takes a single parameter\n",
    "\n",

    "# Exception Safety And Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving exception safety in C++ goes beyond merely handling errors. It's rooted in designing your code to remain consistent and robust even when exceptions are thrown. Exception safety is categorized into different guarantees, each ensuring a specific level of safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Guarantee: \n",
    "The basic guarantee promises that no resources are leaked, and all objects remain in a valid state even after an exception. Though the exact state might be unpredictable, it ensures the object's consistency.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class BasicGuarantee {\n",
    "    int* data;\n",
    "\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void setData(int value) {\n",
    "        int* temp = new int(value);  // Allocate new memory\n",
    "        delete data;                 // Delete old memory\n",
    "        data = temp;                 // Assign new memory\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    // Other members and destructor\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strong Guarantee: \n",
    "The strong guarantee takes it a step further. It ensures that operations either complete successfully or have no observable side effects, preserving object state.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class StrongGuarantee {\n",
    "    std::vector<int> data;\n",
    "\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void addElement(int value) {\n",
    "        std::vector<int> temp = data;\n",
    "        temp.push_back(value);\n",
    "        data = temp;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if pushing back to the temp vector throws an exception, the main data vector remains unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No-Throw Guarantee\n",
    "As the pinnacle of exception safety, the no-throw guarantee asserts that a function will never throw any exceptions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "void NoThrowFunction() noexcept {\n",
    "    // Code that is guaranteed not to throw\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to this principle, you ensure utmost stability, especially in performance-critical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Leveraging Smart Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "Using smart pointers like std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr greatly improves exception safety. They manage resource ownership, ensuring no leaks, even when exceptions arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating smart pointers removes manual memory management, reducing the risk of leaks due to unexpected exceptions.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Stack Unwinding in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Unwinding is the process of removing function entries from function call stack at run time. The local objects are destroyed in reverse order in which they were constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Unwinding is generally related to Exception Handling. \n",
    "In C++, when an exception occurs, the function call stack is linearly searched for the exception handler, and all the entries before the function with exception handler are removed from the function call stack. \n",
    "So, exception handling involves Stack Unwinding if an exception is not handled in the same function (where it is thrown). \n",
    "Basically, Stack unwinding is a process of calling the destructors (whenever an exception is thrown) for all the automatic objects constructed at run time. \n",

    "# How to Handle exception at C++ constructor using Boost's Shared Ptr\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a very common problem in C++ that if a class's constructor throws an exception (say memory allocation exception) how we should handle it. \n",
    "\n",
    "suppose we need to allocate some dynamic memory in the constructor... and while doing that the constructor throws a memory exception... so the stack based pointer which was referencing the heap based memory will be destroyed because of the stack unwinding... so we will have some memory which is referenced by no pointer and hence we cannot access that... so obviously its a memory leak... so, how can we handle that...\n",
    "\n",
    "the best way to handle this kind of situation in modern C++ is to use auto_ptr/shared_ptr... so the solution will look something as the following:\n",
