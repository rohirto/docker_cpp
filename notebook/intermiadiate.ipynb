    "## What is an Object\n",
    "In programming, objects are independent units, and each has its own identity, just as objects in the real world do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects also have characteristics that are used to describe them\n",
    "These characteristics are also called attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "An attribute describes the current state of an object.\n",
    "Objects can have multiple attributes (the mug can be empty, red and large).\n",
    "\n",
    "behavior is specific to the object's type.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the following three dimensions describe any object in object oriented programming: identity, attributes, behavior.\n",
    "In programming, an object is self-contained, with its own identity. It is separate from other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object has its own attributes, which describe its current state. Each exhibits its own behavior, which demonstrates what they can do. "

    "## What is a Class\n",
    "Objects are created using classes, which are actually the focal point of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a class can be described as an object's blueprint, description, or definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the same class as a blueprint for creating multiple different objects. For example, in preparation to creating a new building, the architect creates a blueprint, which is used as a basis for actually building the structure. That same blueprint can be used to create multiple buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming works in the same fashion. We first define a class, which becomes the blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each class has a name, and describes attributes and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, the term type is used to refer to a class name: We're creating an object of a particular type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are also referred to as properties or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods \n",
    "\n",
    "Method is another term for a class' behavior. A method is basically a function that belongs to a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are similar to functions - they are blocks of code that are called, and they can also perform actions and return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object is called an instance of a class. The process of creating objects is called instantiation.\n"

    "## Abstraction\n",
    "Data abstraction is the concept of providing only essential information to the outside world. It's a process of representing essential features without including implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good real-world example is a book: When you hear the term book, you don't know the exact specifics, i.e.: the page count, the color, the size, but you understand the idea of a book - the abstraction of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of abstraction is that we focus on essential qualities, rather than the specific characteristics of one particular example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction means, that we can have an idea or a concept that is completely separate from any specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the fundamental building blocks of object oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you use cout, you're actually using the cout object of the class ostream. This streams data to result in standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, there is no need to understand how cout will display the text on the user's screen. The only thing you need to know to be able to use it is the public interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction allows us to write a single bank account class, and then create different objects based on the class, for individual bank accounts, rather than creating a separate class for each bank account. \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction acts as a foundation for the other object orientation fundamentals, such as inheritance and polymorphism. These will be discussed later in the course.\n"

    "## Encapsulation \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the meaning of the word encapsulation is the idea of \"surrounding\" an entity, not just to keep what's inside together, but also to protect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object orientation, encapsulation means more than simply combining attributes and behavior together within a class; it also means restricting access to the inner workings of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key principle here is that an object only reveals what the other application components require to effectively run the application. All else is kept out of view\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we take our BankAccount class, we do not want some other part of our program to reach in and change the balance of any object, without going through the deposit() or withdraw() behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should hide that attribute, control access to it, so it is accessible only by the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the balance cannot be directly changed from outside of the object and is accessible only using its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also known as \"black boxing\", which refers to closing the inner working zones of the object, except of the pieces that we want to make public.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to change attributes and implementation of methods without altering the overall program. For example, we can come back later and change the data type of the balance attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary the benefits of encapsulation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control the way data is accessed or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change one part of code without affecting other part of code."
