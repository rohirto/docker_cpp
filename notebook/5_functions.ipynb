    "## Stack and Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory that a program uses is typically divided into a few different areas, called segments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code segment (also called a text segment), where the compiled program sits in memory. The code segment is typically read-only.\n",
    "- The bss segment (also called the uninitialized data segment), where zero-initialized global and static variables are stored.\n",
    "- The data segment (also called the initialized data segment), where initialized global and static variables are stored.\n",
    "- The heap, where dynamically allocated variables are allocated from.\n",
    "- The call stack, where function parameters, local variables, and other function-related information are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The heap segment\n",
    "The heap segment (also known as the ‚Äúfree store‚Äù) keeps track of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.\n",
    "In C++, when you use the new operator to allocate memory, this memory is allocated in the application‚Äôs heap segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    int* ptr { new int }; // ptr is assigned 4 bytes in the heap\n",
    "    int* array { new int[10] }; // array is assigned 40 bytes in the heap\n",
    "\n",
    "When a dynamically allocated variable is deleted, the memory is ‚Äúreturned‚Äù to the heap and can then be reassigned as future allocation requests are received. Remember that deleting a pointer does not delete the variable, it just returns the memory at the associated address back to the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heap has advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allocating memory on the heap is comparatively slow.\n",
    "- Allocated memory stays allocated until it is specifically deallocated (beware memory leaks) or the application ends (at which point the OS should clean it up).\n",
    "- Dynamically allocated memory must be accessed through a pointer. Dereferencing a pointer is slower than accessing a variable directly.\n",
    "- Because the heap is a big pool of memory, large arrays, structures, or classes can be allocated here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Call Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack (usually referred to as ‚Äúthe stack‚Äù) has a much more interesting role to play. The call stack keeps track of all the active functions (those that have been called but have not yet terminated) from the start of the program to the current point of execution, and handles allocation of all function parameters and local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack is implemented as a stack data structure:\n",
    "A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The call stack segment\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack segment holds the memory used for the call stack. When the application starts, the main() function is pushed on the call stack by the operating system. Then the program begins executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function call is encountered, the function is pushed onto the call stack. When the current function ends, that function is popped off the call stack (this process is sometimes called unwinding the stack). Thus, by looking at the functions that are currently on the call stack, we can see all of the functions that were called to get to the current point of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    " The ‚Äúmarker‚Äù is a register (a small piece of memory in the CPU) known as the stack pointer (sometimes abbreviated ‚ÄúSP‚Äù). The stack pointer keeps track of where the top of the call stack currently is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The call stack in action\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs examine in more detail how the call stack works. Here is the sequence of steps that takes place when a function is called:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The program encounters a function call.\n",
    "- A stack frame is constructed and pushed on the stack. The stack frame consists of:\n",
    "    + The address of the instruction beyond the function call (called the return address). This is how the CPU remembers where to return to after the called function exits.\n",
    "    + All function arguments.\n",
    "    + Memory for any local variables\n",
    "    + Saved copies of any registers modified by the function that need to be restored when the function returns\n",
    "- The CPU jumps to the function‚Äôs start point.\n",
    "- The instructions inside of the function begin executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the function terminates, the following steps happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Registers are restored from the call stack\n",
    "- The stack frame is popped off the stack. This frees the memory for all local variables and arguments.\n",
    "- The return value is handled.\n",
    "- The CPU resumes execution at the return address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return values can be handled in a number of different ways, depending on the computer‚Äôs architecture. Some architectures include the return value as part of the stack frame. Others use CPU registers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A technical note: on some architectures, the call stack grows away from memory address 0. On others, it grows towards memory address 0. As a consequence, newly pushed stack frames may have a higher or a lower memory address than the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stack overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack has a limited size, and consequently can only hold a limited amount of information. On Visual Studio for Windows, the default stack size is 1MB. With g++/Clang for Unix variants, it can be as large as 8MB. If the program tries to put too much information on the stack, stack overflow will result. Stack overflow happens when all the memory in the stack has been allocated -- in that case, further allocations begin overflowing into other sections of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack overflow is generally the result of allocating too many variables on the stack, and/or making too many nested function calls (where function A calls function B calls function C calls function D etc‚Ä¶) On modern operating systems, overflowing the stack will generally cause your OS to issue an access violation and terminate the program.\n",
