    "#### Why is std::ws needed?\n",
    "When you enter a value using operator>>, std::cin not only captures the value, it also captures the newline character ('\\n') that occurs when you hit the enter key. So when we type 2 and then hit enter, std::cin captures the string \"2\\n\" as input. It then extracts the value 2 to variable choice, leaving the newline character behind for later. Then, when std::getline() goes to extract text to name, it sees \"\\n\" is already waiting in std::cin, and figures we must have previously entered an empty string! Definitely not what was intended."
