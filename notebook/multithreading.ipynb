    "# Multithreading in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU. Each part of such a program is called a thread. So, threads are lightweight processes within a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading support was introduced in C++11. Prior to C++11, we had to use POSIX threads or ```<pthreads>``` library. While this library did the job the lack of any standard language-provided feature set caused serious portability issues. C++ 11 did away with all that and gave us std::thread. The thread classes and related functions are defined in the ```<thread>``` header file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```std::thread thread_object (callable);```\n",
    "\n",
    "std::thread is the thread class that represents a single thread in C++. To start a thread we simply need to create a new thread object and pass the executing code to be called (i.e, a callable object) into the constructor of the object. Once the object is created a new thread is launched which will execute the code specified in callable. A callable can be any of the five:\n",
