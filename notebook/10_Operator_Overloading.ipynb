    "## C++ Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading. Operator overloading is a compile-time polymorphism. For example, we can overload an operator ‘+’ in a class like String so that we can concatenate two strings by just using +. Other example classes where arithmetic operators may be overloaded are Complex Numbers, Fractional Numbers, Big integers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int a;\n",
    "float b,sum;\n",
    "sum = a + b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, variables “a” and “b” are of types “int” and “float”, which are built-in data types. Hence the addition operator ‘+’ can easily add the contents of “a” and “b”. This is because the addition operator “+” is predefined to add variables of built-in data type only. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if we have something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "class A{\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    A a1, a2, a3;\n",
    "    a3 = a1+a2;  //This will give compiler error, as behaviour of '+' vis a vis a1 and a2 objects is not defined\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "we have 3 variables “a1”, “a2” and “a3” of type “class A”. Here we are trying to add two objects “a1” and “a2”, which are of user-defined type i.e. of type “class A” using the “+” operator. This is not allowed, because the addition operator “+” is predefined to operate only on built-in data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here, “class A” is a user-defined type, so the compiler generates an error. This is where the concept of “Operator overloading” comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the user wants to make the operator “+” add two class objects, the user has to redefine the meaning of the “+” operator such that it adds two class objects. This is done by using the concept of “Operator overloading”.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the main idea behind “Operator overloading” is to use C++ operators with class variables or class objects. Redefining the meaning of operators really does not change their original meaning; instead, they have been given additional meaning along with their existing ones.\n",

    "1) For operator overloading to work, at least one of the operands must be a user-defined class object.\n",

    "# Overloading stream insertion (<>) operators in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, stream insertion operator “<<” is used for output and extraction operator “>>” is used for input. \n",
    "\n",
    "PREREQUESTISES\n",
    "1) cout is an object of ostream class and cin is an object of istream class \n",
    "2) These operators must be overloaded as a global function. And if we want to allow them to access private data members of the class, we must make them friend. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why these operators must be overloaded as global? \n",
    "\n",
    "In operator overloading, if an operator is overloaded as a member, then it must be a member of the object on the left side of the operator. For example, consider the statement “ob1 + ob2” (let ob1 and ob2 be objects of two different classes). To make this statement compile, we must overload ‘+’ in a class of ‘ob1’ or make ‘+’ a global function. \n",
    "The operators ‘<<‘ and ‘>>’ are called like ‘cout << ob1’ and ‘cin >> ob1’. So if we want to make them a member method, then they must be made members of ostream and istream classes, which is not a good option most of the time. Therefore, these operators are overloaded as global functions with two parameters, cout and object of user-defined class.\n",
